1.1 Run the local server
You're ready to actually start work on our app! Let's run the app locally!

Run the following Firebase CLI command: sh firebase serve --only hosting

Your command line should display the following response: hosting: Local server: http://localhost:5000

We're using the Firebase Hosting emulator to serve our app locally. The web app should now be available from http://localhost:5000.

Open your app at http://localhost:5000.
You should see your copy of FirebaseRTC which has been connected to your Firebase project.

The app has automatically connected to your Firebase project.
